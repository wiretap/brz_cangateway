# brz_cangateway
CANBUS Gateway for BRZ/GT86/FRS

Required Libraries
- CircularBuffer
- due_can
- DueTimer

Intended for CopperHillTech jcom.can.due and Arduino Due

The objective is to decode the BRZ/FRS/GT86 canbus and create a CAN Gateway that can be used to facilitate engine swaps that either use OEM or aftermarket ECU solutions. This vehicle is designed to be modified, lets lower the barrier to entry!

Contribute your decoded CANBUS messages, and/or code.

It is recognised that the results of this research and reverse-engineering may end up in commercial ECU solutions, however we believe that this, in the long term, still benefits the community by making engine swaps more readily possible.
